## Notes
A Git commit template I personally like to follow: [link](https://gist.github.com/adeekshith/cd4c95a064977cdc6c50)
### Watchman
Jest uses Watchman by default, to install: `brew install watchman`
### EditorConfig
Consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. I use VSCode, but other devs might prefer Sublime or Atom.
### NVM
Make sure everybody is on the same Node version by using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
```
nvm use
```
### Yarn
Make sure to install [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

## Installation
### Run app
```
yarn start
```
### Build app
```
yarn run build
```
### Test app
```
yarn test
```
