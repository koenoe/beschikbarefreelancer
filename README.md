## Notes
A Git commit template I personally like to follow: [link](https://gist.github.com/adeekshith/cd4c95a064977cdc6c50)
### Watchman
Jest uses Watchman by default, to install: `brew install watchman`
### EditorConfig
Consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. I use VSCode, but other devs might prefer Sublime or Atom.
### NVM
Make sure everybody is on the same Node version by using a Node Version Manager.
At time of writing LTS is 8.9.4, so let's stick to that.
### NPM
I enable `save-exact` by default, so all devs are using the exact same version of used packages.

## Installation
### Run app
```
npm start
```
### Build app
```
npm run build
```
### Test app
```
npm test
```
